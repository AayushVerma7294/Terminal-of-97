Apart from my known ones I dont know how did you end up here. Anyway
Welcome! to my project named " terminal of 99" in which decided to create a game using the best programming language I know 
My code looks messy ( its been a long time since i can enjoy my hobbies which is spending hours in front of computer to make
50 lines of nothing ) LOL

I will improve this if i manage my time properly.

Its my first time in Github.
